 Lie down in prone position on the flat surface area.
 Keep your feet together and toes against the floor, facing upwards.
 Now keep our hand palms by the side of your chest.
 Your arms should be close to your body and elbows pointing upwards.
 Now raise your shoulders using the strength of your arms. Using your back muscles, raise your chest.
 Now use the strength of your arms to raise your trunk. Look upward trying to hold your breath.
 Keep this position for 15-20 seconds.
 Now exhale and slowly lower yourself getting down to starting position.
 Relax and take a deep breath.
